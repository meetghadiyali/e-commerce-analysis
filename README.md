# E-Commerce Analysis

* Using data to conduct **exploratory analysis** on an international e-commerce company. 
* Derived key insights from the customer databse. 
* Plotted Bar, Pie, Box and Heat graphs for the analysis. 
* Used Jupyter Notebook for the analysis. 
* Data Input was a csv file. 



### Graphs from the Analysis
---

#### Distribution of Prodcut Prices:

* The prices of products vary from $96 for the product to $310, but the prices of products that have the highest sales records are between $225 and $275.


---

#### Distribution of Product Weights:

* The distribution of the weight is bimodal, we can see that the most frequent product weights are between 1000gm to 1500gm followed by weights that range from 4500gm up to 5500gm, and there is an outlier that is in between 7000gm and 8000gm.

#### Gender Proportion:

* The most frequent mode of shipping is ship, both flight and road have the equal share. 

---

#### Rate of delivering product on time:

* Despite *ship* being the most common used mode of shipment, it does not have the highest rate of delievering the products on time, but the differences between each mode of shipment is small, so maybe there is another reason behind using it, maybe it's cost of shipping is less than others, but we don't have data in this dataset to prove it. 
* Percentage of shipments that reached on time using *Flight* : 60 %
* Percentage of shipments that reached on time using *Ship* : 59.7 %
* Percentage of shipments that reached on time using *Road* : 58.8 %


---

#### Proportion of shipping on time vs not on time:

* 60% of the shipments were delieverd on time.


---

#### Relationship between Gender and Discount Offered:

* Products with high importance tend to have higher discount, and in this product category women tend to have higher discounts than men.


---

#### Product category vs Sales (quantity): 
![](https://github.com/meetghadiyali/e-commerce-analysis/blob/main/sales-product.png)

* Low quality products sell the most followed by medium quality and high quality products are far less than them in terms of sales.


---

#### Product category vs Sales (price):
![](https://github.com/meetghadiyali/e-commerce-analysis/blob/main/sales-quality.png)

* Sales of low quality products exceed 1 Million USD, sales of medium quality products is almost 1 Million USD, while sales of high quality products are below 200k USD. 


---

#### Relationship between product quality - gender - total sales: 
![](https://github.com/meetghadiyali/e-commerce-analysis/blob/main/sales-gender.png)

* Women buy more medium quality products than men who buy more high quality products.

#### Shipment enquiry calls: 
![](https://github.com/meetghadiyali/e-commerce-analysis/blob/main/ship-enquiry.png)

* The most common number of calls made from enquiry for enquiry of the shipment is 4 calls, 3 calls is also a frequent number, and numbers like 2 calls or 7 calls are rare, so on average customer makes from 3 to 5 calls during the shipment process.
